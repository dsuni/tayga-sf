Uploading tayga
===============

Please consider using dgit when uploading tayga. When your source
changes are ready, run:

    dgit --quilt=gbp build-source

That will do basic sanity checks (e.g. that there are no uncommitted changes)
and generate a source package in the parent directory. Then run:

    dgit --quilt=gbp push

This will add the commit hash to the .dsc file, sign the changes file, push
your changes to dgit and upload the source package to the archive.
